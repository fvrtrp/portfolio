Time has seemingly flown past incomprehensibly the last few years.
Maybe I've been living in slow motion. At least, it feels like it.
There have been pursuits of a million things, with varying upshots.
There are things I really want to spend time on, improve on, enjoy and live with.
I will most likely justify & delineate each of these in a different blog, but I'd like to gather my ideas first.
There was initially a division into **Eventually**, **Later** and **Now** to help me understand what I want better, but I've stripped that part off.
Some of these in no particular order:

1. Master Piano, make music, sing.
2. The polyglot: Spanish, French, German, and more.
3. Read books
4. Design journey - learn by mimicking designs.
5. Science journey - bioinformatics and shiz.
6. AI journey - Deep learning v2, projects, etc.
7. The creator: consistent blogs, videos.
8. hacker: leetcode, network, security and shiz.
9. Side things: make apps, games, and cool shiz.
10. Routine: Stick to the plan.
11. Love and peace: Love, Meditate, Travel.
